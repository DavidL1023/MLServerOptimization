# Nicholas Model

This is a LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Model. It is a type of RNN (Recurrent Neural Network), and it is commonly used for time series analysis (among other things).

First run new_editor1.py, then new_editor2.py, then half_hour_agg.py to get the version of the dataset that is needed for the model.

Final_LSTM_Model.ipynb contains all the code for the LSTM model. The graph of the predicted values vs the real values can be seen both in the ipynb file and in the png file.
